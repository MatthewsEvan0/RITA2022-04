Summary/TL;DR
  With my additional participation and volunteer efforts into RIT Ambulance, I decided to dedicate my major project to giving the RITA website a long-overdue facelift.
  Before starting this, I had a minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any ability to design a good looking website. 
  I still lack the ability to create anything aesthetically pleasing. 
  While I am still actively working on the website, I do feel I have satisfied the time and learning "requirements". 
  I hoped to do something for floor in the beginning, but my technical knowledge is far outweighed. 


Kicked off this project in early December 2021 and have been working on it roughly on and off. After repeatedly starting from scratch and onto a third attempt, I think I have landed on a design I actually like. Most of the time I have put into this project has been the "perfectionist" little details, getting spacing right, and overall obtaining a design I think is aesthetically pleasing. I still have things to iron out. My entire goal is to write the entire website and systems we use from scratch with modern, cleaned up code. The current website has plenty of Javascript that I have yet to get into. I am actively learning javascript to replicate the systems that are currently in place. My hope is to fully work the current website out of existence with something newer that I know I created.
